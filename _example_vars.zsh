# The _vars file, which is git-ignored, contains variables used
# in subsequent custom scripts. These change frequently and will
# be different on different systems and so should not be in
# source control.

# This example file gives an indication of what values are
# expected:

# ofFolder='of097'
# ipMask='192.168.1.10' #(the final character is missing from the mask)
# port='1002'
# sshPhrase='mypassword'
# osxUser='myusername'
# piUser='piusername'
# numPis=5
