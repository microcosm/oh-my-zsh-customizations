# The _vars file, which is git-ignored, contains variables used

# be different on different systems and so should not be in
# source control.

# This example file gives an indication of what values are
# expected:

# testMode=true
# numPis=5
# ofFolder='of097'
# ipMask='192.168.1.10' #(the final character is missing from the mask)
# port='1002'
# piUser='myusername'
# piPass='mypassword'
# mmUser='myusername'
# mmPass='mypassword'
