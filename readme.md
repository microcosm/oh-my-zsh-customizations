Instructions for new system (**Warning** this is destructive to the `custom` folder, which in a new system should be example files only)
- Install iTerm and Oh My Zsh if necessary ([example](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070))
- `rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom && mkdir !$ && cd !$`
- `git clone git@github.com:microcosm/oh-my-zsh-customizations.git .`
- Modify the theme to Powerlevel10k if desired (see above URL)
